## **SHORT FILM PIPELINE**

This application can be used to build, manage, and optimise film making pipelines.

The latest version is compatible with Windows 10 and may run on earlier versions. It does not run in Maya 2016 or lower.

Due to VFX Reference Platform and the large invention, we need to stay with python 2.7 but expect to migrate to python 3 in 2019.

Details are as follows:

**LIBRARY SUPPORT**

I spent many years to build this library for texturing and referencing. The library is now freely availalbe to everyone. 

For V-ray Materials in Maya, you will need this plugin:

    VMM for maya: https://www.mediafire.com/#gu9s1tbb2u4g9
    After downloading it, remember to configure the path once it is opened in Maya.
    Unfortunately, the original author has stopped developing the plugin.

**RUN PIPELINE TOOL**

Download and extract the zip file, remember to rename the folder as 'PipelineTool'.

Go to the diretory of 'PipelineTool' folder, hold down Shift + right-click -> Open PowerShell window here/Open command window here

In CommandPrompt/WindowShell:

    "start python main.py" then enter to run.

A user login window will show up. Login with your username and password.

If you do not have an account, simply create one. I have updated the register function.

* Update sql, now data is being stored to database file.
* Tranfering configurations of the pipeline into database, not using yml.
